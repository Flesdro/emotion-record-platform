## description
As you can see above, this is a platform that allows user to shart their thoughts(emotionally, not technically haha), the platform can read and analyze their words to see if the user is mentally healthy. Besides, I want to create a virtual character to let the user talk with them. This might need a new tech i heard last year(probably not that new :p) - MCP, it's cool, and I think it can make common people get access to fine-tuning a LLM by writing prompt,instead of change the parameters. Anyway, this project is still building and today i just finished initializing.
